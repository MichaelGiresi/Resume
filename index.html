                <h3>Portfolio <br/>michaelgiresi.com</h3>
                <p>While building my portfolio website, I overcame several challenges. This was the first website I built by myself, so there was much to learn, in terms of figuring out css best practices, and implementing GSAP. I wanted to use GSAP to get experience with a more complicated animation framework. The CSS was re-written several times, as I learned more about how best to style the content of the site. After purchasing HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett, I found and corrected several holes in my knowlegebase, and applied these new best practices to the site. </p>

                <h3>Algorythmia</h3>
                <p>Algorythmia is a brand focused e-commerce website. The challenges building Algorythmia were creating a cart, managing the state of that cart, and having the close and open animations work as intended. I also incorporated react router dom, to handle the different pages of the site.</p>

                <h3>Matchbox Stickers</h3>
                <p>Matchbox Stickers is a creator focused e-commerce website. It is designed to have many creators upload a series of their products to be sold, with a small quantity available for each product. Building this website brought on new challenges, specifically regarding video playback and controls. I ended up finding a solution to selecting the exact time I wanted the playback to change to, by creating a custom video player.</p>

                <h1>Education</h1>
                <h3>The Mannes College of Music at The New School</h3>
                <h4>Master of Music (2015-2017)</h4>
                <p id="masters-info">The Masters program I attended was rigours and demanding in different ways than my bachelors degree. In performance, we were expected to lead by example, and be good role models for the younger students. I was fortunate enough to perform several times at many of the country's greatest venues, including Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall.</p>
                <h4>Bachelor degree of Music (2011-2015)</h4>
                <p>During my Bachelors degree, I was fortunate enough to study with some of the greatest musicians in the world. Raymond Riccomini of the Metropolitan Opera, Thomas Smith of the New York Philharmonic, and Vincent Penzarella of The New York Philharmonic, MET Opera, and the NYC Ballet, to name a few. From these greats, I learned the value of giving 100% of your focus towards a task. How to lead a section, and the orchestra. And overal, how to lead a good life and make the world a better place, in the ways we are able. At the Mannes College of Music, my professors were world class. I learned so much more than music from them, and I carry many of these lessons with me to this day. </p>
