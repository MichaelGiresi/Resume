                <h3>Portfolio <br/>michaelgiresi.com</h3>
                <p>For my portfolio website, I wanted to make something that describes me and showcases my projects and skills. While building this project, I overcame several challenges, primarially the challenge of GSAP animation, and CSS best practices. I ended up rewriting the CSS for this website several times, as I learned more about how best to structure the content of this site. </p>

                <h3>Algorythmia</h3>
                <p>Algorythmia is a brand focused e-commerce website. While building this, I learned about how best to structure many tiles of the same size, and how to create a cart that has a up to date cart quantity counter. I also incorporated react router dom, to handle the different pages of the site.</p>

                <h3>Matchbox Stickers</h3>
                <p>Matchbox Stickers is a creator focused e-commerce website. It is designed to have many creators upload a series of their products to be sold, with a small quantity available for each product. The main challenge of this site was building custom video player controls, and building a video player from scratch.</p>

                <h1>Education</h1>
                <h3>The Mannes College of Music at The New School</h3>
                <h4>Master of Music (2015-2017)</h4>
                <p id="masters-info">The Masters program I attended was rigours and demanding in different ways than my bachelors degree. In performance, we were expected to be leaders, and show the younger students how to play, as well as act. I was fortunate enough to perform several times at many of the country's greatest venues, including Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall.</p>
                <h4>Bachelor degree of Music (2011-2015)</h4>
                <p>During my Bachelors degree, I was fortunate enough to study with some of the greatest musicians in the world. Raymond Riccomini of the Metropolitan Opera, Thomas Smith of the New York Philharmonic, and Vincent Penzarella of The New York Philharmonic, MET Opera, and the NYC Ballet, to name a few. From these greats, I learned the value of giving 100% of your focus towards a task. How to lead a section, and the orchestra. And overal, how to lead a good life and produce happiness for the listener. At the Mannes College of Music, my professors were world class. I learned so much more than music from them, and I carry many of these lessons with me to this day. </p>
